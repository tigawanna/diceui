  TimePickerSeparator,
  TimePickerTrigger,
  TimePickerContent,
  TimePickerHour,
  TimePickerMinute,

    <TimePickerLabel />
    <TimePickerInputGroup>
      <TimePickerInput segment="hour" />
      <TimePickerSeparator />
      <TimePickerInput segment="minute" />
      <TimePickerInput segment="period" />
      <TimePickerTrigger />
    </TimePickerInputGroup>
    <TimePickerContent>
      <TimePickerHour />
      <TimePickerMinute />
      <TimePickerClear />

  </TimePicker>
)
```

## Examples

### With Step

Use the `hourStep`, `minuteStep`, and `secondStep` props to set custom intervals for hour, minute, and second selection respectively.

<ComponentTabs name="time-picker-step-demo" />

### With Seconds

Include seconds in time selection.

<ComponentTabs name="time-picker-seconds-demo" />

### Custom Placeholders

Customize empty segment placeholders for different display formats.

<ComponentTabs name="time-picker-placeholder-demo" />

### Open on Focus

Use the `openOnFocus` prop to open the content when the input is focused.

<ComponentTabs name="time-picker-open-on-focus-demo" />

### Input Group Click Action

Configure what happens when clicking on empty space in the input group. By default, it focuses the first input for inline editing, but you can set it to open the popover instead.

<ComponentTabs name="time-picker-input-group-click-action-demo" />

### Controlled State

Control the time picker value programmatically.

<ComponentTabs name="time-picker-controlled-demo" />

### With Form

Use the time picker in a form with validation.

<ComponentTabs name="time-picker-form-demo" />

## API Reference

### TimePicker

The main container component for time picker functionality.

<AutoTypeTable
  path="./types/docs/time-picker.ts"
  name="TimePickerProps"
/>

<DataAttributesTable
  data={[
    {
      title: "[data-disabled]",
      value: "Present when the time picker is disabled",
    },
    {
      title: "[data-invalid]",
      value: "Present when the time picker is invalid",
    },
    {
      title: "[data-readonly]",
      value: "Present when the time picker is read-only",
    },
  ]}
/>

### TimePickerLabel

The label component for the time picker field.

<AutoTypeTable
  path="./types/docs/time-picker.ts"
  name="TimePickerLabelProps"
/>

### TimePickerInputGroup

The container for input segments that sets up CSS variables for dynamic segment widths.

<AutoTypeTable
  path="./types/docs/time-picker.ts"
  name="TimePickerInputGroupProps"
/>

<DataAttributesTable
  data={[
    {
      title: "[data-disabled]",
      value: "Present when the time picker is disabled",
    },
    {
      title: "[data-invalid]",
      value: "Present when the time picker is invalid",
    },
  ]}
/>

<CSSVariablesTable
  data={[
    {
      title: "--time-picker-hour-input-width",
      description: "The width of the hour input segment, dynamically calculated based on the hour placeholder length.",
      defaultValue: "2ch (for '--' placeholder)",
    },
    {
      title: "--time-picker-minute-input-width",
      description: "The width of the minute input segment, dynamically calculated based on the minute placeholder length.",
      defaultValue: "2ch (for '--' placeholder)",
    },
    {
      title: "--time-picker-second-input-width",
      description: "The width of the second input segment, dynamically calculated based on the second placeholder length.",
      defaultValue: "2ch (for '--' placeholder)",
    },
    {
      title: "--time-picker-period-input-width",
      description: "The width of the period (AM/PM) input segment, dynamically calculated based on the period placeholder length.",
      defaultValue: "2ch (for '--' placeholder)",
    },
  ]}
/>

Must use style prop to override the css variables of the input segment, because the width is dynamically calculated based on the placeholder length.

    },
    {
      title: "[data-readonly]",
      value: "Present when the time picker is read-only",
    },
    {
      title: "[data-invalid]",
      value: "Present when the time picker is invalid",

      value: "The side where the content is positioned",
    },
    {
      title: "[data-align]",
      value: "The alignment of the content",

## Notes

### Behavior

- **Native HTML time input behavior**: Replicates the exact behavior of `<input type="time">` for maximum familiarity
  - Auto-pads single digits instantly (typing "1" shows "01")
  - Smart auto-advance after two digits or when digit exceeds maximum first digit
  - Partial time values supported (e.g., "10:--" instead of "10:00")
  - Selection preserved after actions for seamless typing
- **Inline editing**: All time segments are always visible and editable, no need to open the content
- **Content for convenience**: The clock icon trigger opens the content for easier selection with mouse/touch
- **Keyboard-first design**: Full keyboard navigation between segments using arrow keys or tab
- **Clear segments**: Press Backspace or Delete on a selected segment to clear it back to "--"

### Format & Locale

- **Automatic format detection**: Display format (12-hour vs 24-hour) is automatically detected from user's locale settings
- **Consistent value format**: The time value is always stored in 24-hour format ("HH:mm" or "HH:mm:ss"), regardless of display format
- **Locale override**: Use the `locale` prop to explicitly set a locale (e.g., "en-US" for 12-hour, "en-GB" for 24-hour)
- **Period shortcuts**: In 12-hour format, use A/P or 1/2 keys to quickly set AM/PM

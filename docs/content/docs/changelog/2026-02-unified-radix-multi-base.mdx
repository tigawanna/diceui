description: Migrated to the unified radix-ui package, introduced multi-base component architecture, and optimized utility components.

We've shipped several major improvements to DiceUI's component infrastructure and documentation.

### Unified Radix UI Package

All components have been migrated from individual `@radix-ui/react-*` packages to the unified [`radix-ui`](https://www.radix-ui.com/primitives/docs/overview/getting-started) package. This follows Radix UI's official consolidation effort and simplifies dependency management.

```diff
- import * as SelectPrimitive from "@radix-ui/react-select"
+ import { Select } from "radix-ui"
```

### Optimized Utility Components

The `ClientOnly` and `Portal` components have been rewritten using `useSyncExternalStore` for better performance and proper SSR/hydration handling.

**Benefits:**
- No `useState` + `useLayoutEffect` pattern needed
- Proper SSR/Hydration with explicit server vs client snapshots
- No hydration mismatches
